			<h2>The Team Behind Stylite</h2>

			<p>I was born in Hampton, Virginia but was raised in Newport News, Virginia.
			I grew up with my mom and dad until they divorced, and thankfully they made three beautiful kids -
			including me. I grew up primarily with my mom, but spent half of middle school and all of high school
			with my dad. I moved to Florida a couple of months after graduating from high school. It was quite a
			leap from Virginia to Florida, which is about 1,000 miles from any family member of mine. Currently,
			I attend Full Sail University and I'm earning my bachelors degree in Web Design and Development
			with only a	couple short weeks remaining in the program. I have teamed up with Grant Standridge to
			create an app called Stylite, which will blow your brain up with awesomeness.</p>

			<h3>Grant Standridge</h2>
			<?php echo Asset::img('portraitGrant.jpg') ?>
			<p>Look, I'm an Oklahomie. I was Born and raised in a suburb just north of Tulsa, Okla., and
			I was priviledged to grow up in the middle of a loving family of 5! I have two of the best
			parents in the world, and they have been so helpful during my time at Full Sail - away
			from home. In addition, I have two younger sisters, Kendall and Sydney, who currently reside in
			Oklahoma. After graduation from High School I chose to attend Oklahoma State University	in Stillwater,
			Okla. and earn my bachelors degree in Advertising. It was through that degree and education that I
			realized my passion for the web and design. Soon after graduating from OSU and working an internship, I
			decided to 'take my talents' to the wonderful city of Winter Park, Fla. and attend Full Sail!</p>
